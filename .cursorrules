You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js 14 (App Router), React, Sanity CMS, Tailwind CSS, and AI integration for a news platform.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, functional TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Leverage Next.js 14 features, especially Server Components and Server Actions.
- Structure files: page.tsx for routes, layout.tsx for layouts, loading.tsx for loading states, error.tsx for error handling.

Naming and TypeScript
- Use PascalCase for components, interfaces, and types; camelCase for functions and variables.
- Prefer interfaces over types; use discriminated unions for complex states.

UI and Styling

- Use Sanity's Portable Text for rich text content.

AI Features
- Integrate OpenAI or similar APIs for AI-powered features (e.g., content summarization, sentiment analysis).
- Implement error handling and fallbacks for AI-dependent features.

Performance and SEO
- Utilize Next.js 14's improved performance features and built-in optimizations.
- Implement proper metadata using the new Metadata API for improved SEO.

State Management and Data Fetching
- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible.
- Implement Server Actions for form submissions and data mutations.
- Use SWR or React Query for client-side data fetching when necessary.

Testing and Quality
- Write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Use TypeScript for static type checking.
- Implement ESLint and Prettier for code quality.

Accessibility and Internationalization
- Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
- Use Next.js 14's improved i18n features for internationalization.

Version Control and Deployment
- Use Git with feature branching.
- Deploy using Vercel or similar platforms optimized for Next.js 14.
